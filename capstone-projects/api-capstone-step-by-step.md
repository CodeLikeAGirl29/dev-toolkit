# API capstone steps

1. Create a Proof of Concept

    1.1. come up with useful idea for the capstone

    1.2. find the APIs to support it

    1.3. test that the APIs are working in Ajax and that they are returning the relevant data
2. Create the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

    2.1. create a Github repository (on the Github server) with a name like this: [name-of-the-project] + "-api-capstone"; the name will contain only lower case letters and dashes (-) between the words

    2.2. clone locally in order to create the local folder

    2.3. in this folder we will create a blank index.html file; styles.css file; app.js file

    2.4. in index.html will create the links to the styles.css and the app.js

    2.5. in the same folder will create an empty readme file

    2.6. follow the Thinkful course part about the wireframes and user cases

    2.7. create the html and css look and feel to the height of detail possible without javascript

    2.8. create the JS functionality (will integrate the API tests from the beginning)
3. Convert the MVP into the final product

    3.1. make the website easy to use by the visitor (3 clicks rule)

    3.2. make website code easy to maintain (extensive comments where necessary)

    3.3. add the necessary accessibility code

    3.4. improve the overall speed of the website

    3.5. end to end testing

    3.6. graceful error handling

    3.7. non-tech user feedback

    3.8. complete the readme file
4. Deliver
