# Most Common Coding Mistakes
* typos:
    * __to avoid__ define a variable, object, array or function then use copy / paste instead of typing repeatedly;
* typing too fast with a lot of mistakes:
    * __to avoid__ if you use the backspace more than 3 time for line of code it means that the hands are moving way to fast and the brain has a hard time catching up; slow your typing to about 50% to increase the code accuracy and efficiency
* carelessly selecting the wrong code for cut / copy / paste or delete operations:
    * __to avoid__ make sure to include the closing and opening parenthesis, curly / square brackets, etc.
* ignoring the error output and guessing a solution, which usually leads to breaking the code further before fixing it:
    * __to avoid__ spend more time understanding the problem in order to find the solution easier
