# Final capstone steps

* in the readme file
     * description
     * user stories
     * wireframes
* when that is done
     * in the public
     * html, css responsive and accessible
* when that is done
     * jqeury triggers
     * client.js api calls
     * server.js api endpoints
     * models
* node testing

## Create a Proof of Concept (Minimum Viable Product)
* come up with useful idea for the capstone
* find the APIs to support it
* test that the APIs are working in Ajax and that they are returning the relevant data

## Create the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
* create a Github repository (on the Github server) with a name like this: [name-of-the-project] + [name-of-the-used-apis] + "capstone"; the name will contain only lower case letters and dashes (-) between the words
* clone locally in order to create the local folder
* in this folder we will create a blank index.html file; styles.css file; app.js file
* in index.html will create the links to the styles.css and the app.js
* in the same folder will create an empty readme file
* follow the Thinkful course part about the wireframes and user cases
* create the html and css look and feel to the height of detail possible without javascript
* create the JS functionality (will integrate the API tests from the beginning )

## Convert the MVP into the final product

* make the website easy to use by the visitor (3 click rule)
* make website code easy to maintain (expensive comments where necessary)
* add the necessary accessibility code
* improve the overall speed of the website
* end to end testing
* graceful error handling
* non-tech user feedback
* complete the readme file
