# JavaScript framework vs library

#### This question is highly subjective but the simple answer would be:

* A framework imposes structure upon your code in order to address a particular problem and a library is a generic set of tools that aid you in various tasks, without necessarily addressing the same problem.


#### Detailed answer is:

* Framework: this describes a given structure of "how" you should present your code. Pretty much like a code-template, along some helpers, constructors etc. to solve/simplify a specific problem or bring your architecture in "order". Examples, "Backbone", "requireJS", "socketIO".

* Library: Is an entire toolkit which highly abstracts different layers, like browsers / DOM models / etc. Also as a good toolkit, it offers a lot of tools and neat stuff to work with, which in general, simplify your coding experience. Examples "jQuery", "MooTools", "YUI"


#### Examples:

* jQuery is a library because it abstracts a lot of browser incompatibilities but imposes no structure on your code.
* underscore.js is a library because it's a collection of utilities to manipulate data structures and other goodies.
* backbone.js is a framework because it structures your front-end code to match the MVC pattern.
* Jasmine is a framework because it structures your code so that you can do BDD easily.
