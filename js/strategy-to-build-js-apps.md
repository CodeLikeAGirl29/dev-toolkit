Strategy to build simple js apps
1. identify the input and output in order to understand what we need to convert one into the other
2. console log the elements we need to work with (function input paramenters, one of outputs and then any of the outputs)
3. build an empty output variable
4. populate the output variable based in the input identified earlier and the operations to get there
