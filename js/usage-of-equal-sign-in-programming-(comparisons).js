/*
The Usage of the Equal Sign in programming (Comparisons)

// simple math
1 + 2 = 3

//change the boolean value of the variable to the opposite of it (if the boolean was true is going to be false)
var boolean = true;
boolean = !boolean (OPPOSITE boolean = false)

//non-strict comparisons (compare the variable value only)
//afirmative
3 == "3" //true
//negative
3 != "3" //false

//strict comparisons (compare both value and the type of the variable)
//afirmative
3 === "3" //false becuase 3 is an integer while "3" is a string
//negative
3 !== "3" //true becuase 3 is an integer while "3" is a string



<= is the less or equal to value (ex: 3 <= 9)
>= is the more or equal to value (ex: 13 >= 7)

|| is any of the coditionals is true (ex: if( (animal == "dog") || (animal == "cat") ) )
&& is both the coditionals is true in the same time (ex: if( (animal == "dog") && (animal == "cat") ) )
